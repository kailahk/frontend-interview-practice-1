## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Web-first workflow with optimization for mobile screens smaller than 400px

### What I learned

* With this project, I utilized the background-image CSS property to overlay an alert icon within an input element when appropriate.
* I also practiced writing media queries for smaller viewport sizes.
* I implemented a regular expression to help validate the email string that users input into the form.

### Continued development

* In future projects, I am going to practice mobile-first development.
* I will also continue working on user input validation techqniques.
* I will implement CSS libraries in my future projects.
